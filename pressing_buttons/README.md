Given a string of digits, return all of the possible letter combinations that the number 
could represent. The mapping of digits to letters is the same as you would find on a 
telephone's buttons, as in the example below:

The resulting array should be sorted lexicographically.

Example

For buttons = "42", the output should be
pressingButtons(buttons) = ["ga", "gb", "gc", "ha", "hb", "hc", "ia", "ib", "ic"].
